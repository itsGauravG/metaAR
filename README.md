<b>metaAR</b> is heading towards to be an organisation utilising the full power of AR/VR technology to empower brands and individuals and provide an immersive experience to people in the metaverse. We have started with a mission to bridge the gap between brands and the metaverse and host the brand outlent in the metaverse to elivate the shopping experience. 

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

<ul>
 <li>Poor User experience throughout the process of purchasing a NFT </l1>
 <li>Lack of user engagement  </l1>
 <li>As we are commencing towards metaverse, there is a gap of marketplace which will enable users to buy/sell NFT virtually through VR headsets </l1>
</ul>

<h1>Vision</h1>

Currently, the majority of artworks that are listed on numerous NFT marketplaces are 2D, such as pictures and video loops of animated 3D models. However, given the metaverse's rapid expansion, it is not surprising that immersive technologies and NFTs have come into contact. This has resulted in some amazing experiments from creators who have discovered new, creative methods to combine the two. Find out how these two realms intersect in the following paragraphs and whether augmented reality and virtual reality NFTs are the upcoming big thing.

<h1>Goal</h1>

Our goal is to contribute towards the development of metaverse in its early stages as to stand out from the competition. Also we want to bring creativity and innovation in the metaverse marketplace so that brands can upload and users can buy the NFT’s interacting with it using the VR headset  and controllers in metaverse. As the concept of metaverse is new recently, it will turn out to be more helpful and engaging as we move forward in time.Once NFT-based offices, conferences, schools, movie theaters, and gaming arcades begin operating in virtual worlds, people will gradually transition to the metaverse. Before consumers begin utilizing digital environments extensively, though, they must resemble physical establishments in both appearance and feel.

<h1>Objective </h1>
<ul>
<li>To build a platform in the metaverse for the NFT marketplace. </li>
<li>Enable people to explore NFT virtually rather than in 2D from websites</li>
<li>Help brands to launch their NFT’s in metaverse</li>
<li>Low entry barrier and right platforms to access these NFTs</li>
<li>Focusing on user experience</l1>
 </ul>
